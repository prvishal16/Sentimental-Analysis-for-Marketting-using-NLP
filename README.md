## Overview

In marketing, understanding customer sentiment can improve brand reputation, product development, and customer satisfaction. This project analyzes text data, such as social media posts, reviews, and survey responses, to determine sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, or negative) and provide actionable insights.

## Features

- Preprocessing of raw text data for enhanced accuracy.
- Sentiment classification using pre-trained and custom models.
- Scalable pipeline for analyzing large datasets.
- Visualization of sentiment distribution and trends.
- Support for integration with APIs (e.g., Twitter, customer review platforms).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) for text preprocessing.
  - [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/) for basic sentiment analysis.
  - [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) for social media text.
  - [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) for advanced NLP models.
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for data visualization.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Place your text data files in the `data/` directory, or specify the path to your dataset in the script.

2. **Run Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Perform sentiment analysis using a pre-trained model:
     ```bash
     python sentiment_analysis.py --model pre-trained
     ```
   - Train and evaluate a custom sentiment analysis model:
     ```bash
     python train_sentiment.py --data_path data/customer_reviews.csv
     ```

3. **Visualize Sentiment Trends:**
   - Generate visualizations of sentiment distribution and trends:
     ```bash
     python visualize_sentiment.py --results_path results/sentiment_output.json
     ```
